# My GitHub Pages Site

Welcome to my project! This is a sample page demonstrating various markdown formatting options rendered through GitHub Pages.

---

## About This Project

This project is a **work in progress** and serves as a playground for experimenting with Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It showcases how _italic_, **bold**, and `inline code` all render in the browser.

You can also combine them: **_bold and italic_** text, or even ~~strikethrough~~ for things that are no longer relevant.

---

## Features

- Fast and lightweight static site
- Powered by **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**
- Supports Markdown out of the box
- Easy to customise with themes

### What's Coming

1. A proper landing page
2. A blog section with posts
3. A contact form
4. Dark mode support

---

## Code Examples

Here's a snippet of a simple Python function:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting string."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to my site."

print(greet("World"))
```

And a quick bit of HTML:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
  <p>This is rendered by Jekyll.</p>
</section>
```

## Blockquotes

> "The best way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."
> — Walt Disney

Nested quotes also work:

> Outer quote.
> > Inner quote, for extra emphasis.

## Horizontal Rules & Misc

You can separate sections with a horizontal rule like the ones in this document (`---`).

You can also write footnotes[^1] and reference-style links if your renderer supports them.

[^1]: This is a footnote. GitHub Pages supports these in most themes.
